# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Misaka is a desktop GUI client for Claude Code, built with Python 3.10+ and [Flet](https://flet.dev) 0.80.x (Flutter-based UI framework). It wraps the `claude-agent-sdk` to provide multi-turn streaming conversations, session management, file browsing, MCP server integration, and skill management in a Material Design 3 interface.

**External runtime requirement:** Node.js + `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` CLI installed globally.

## Commands

```bash
# Install for development
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run the application
misaka
# or: python -m misaka.main

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test file
pytest tests/unit/test_session_service.py

# Run a single test by name
pytest -k "test_name"

# Lint
ruff check misaka/

# Type check
mypy misaka/

# Build standalone executable
pip install -e ".[build]"
pyinstaller misaka.spec
```

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

### Key modules

- **`misaka/main.py`** — Entry point. Creates `DatabaseBackend`, `ServiceContainer`, `AppState`, and `AppShell`. Bootstraps the Flet event loop.
- **`misaka/config.py`** — Paths (`~/.misaka/` data dir), env var helpers, `SettingKeys` constants.
- **`misaka/state.py`** — `AppState` — single mutable state object. Components read from it; services mutate it; `state.update()` triggers Flet re-render.
- **`misaka/commands.py`** — Slash command definitions. `immediate=True` commands are handled in UI; `immediate=False` commands inject prompts to Claude.

### ServiceContainer (misaka/main.py)

Plain class that instantiates all services once and wires dependencies. Services are organized into modules under `misaka/services/`:
- `chat/` — Claude conversation services (ClaudeService, SessionService, MessageService, PermissionService)
- `settings/` — Settings management (SettingsService, ProviderService, CliSettingsService, RouterConfigService)
- `mcp/` — MCP server management
- `skills/` — Skills management (SkillService, EnvCheckService)
- `file/` — File operations (FileService, UpdateCheckService)
- `task/` — Task management
- `session/` — Session import
- `common/` — Shared utilities (ClaudeEnvBuilder)

### Database layer (misaka/db/)

- `DatabaseBackend` — ABC defining full CRUD interface
- `SQLiteBackend` — sole implementation (stdlib `sqlite3`, WAL mode)
- `create_database()` — factory that returns SQLiteBackend
- Models are plain `@dataclass` objects, no ORM
- Migrations are incremental, idempotent, versioned via `_schema_version` table

### Claude integration (misaka/services/chat/claude_service.py)

- Wraps `claude-agent-sdk` (`ClaudeSDKClient`) with async streaming
- Builds subprocess environment with API keys, expanded PATH, and Windows-specific `.cmd` → `.js` resolution
- Permission flow: SDK callback → `PermissionService.register()` (asyncio.Future) → UI dialog → `PermissionService.resolve()` with 5-minute timeout

### UI layer (misaka/ui/)

- `AppShell` — root `ft.Row`: NavRail + content area switching between ChatPage, SettingsPage, PluginsPage, ExtensionsPage
- Components organized by feature:
  - `chat/components/` — Chat UI components (ChatView, ChatList, MessageList, etc.)
  - `chat/pages/` — Chat pages (ChatPage, StreamHandler)
  - `settings/pages/` — Settings pages
  - `skills/pages/` — Skills pages (ExtensionsPage, SkillEditorPanel)
  - `file/components/` — File components (FileTree, FilePreview, FolderPicker)
  - `task/components/` — Task components (TaskList)
  - `navigation/` — Navigation components
  - `panels/` — Panel components (RightPanel, ResizeHandle, OffsetMenu)
  - `dialogs/` — Dialog components
  - `status/` — Status components
- Theme: MD3 with accent `#6366f1`, three modes (system/light/dark), persisted in DB

### i18n

JSON locale files in `misaka/i18n/` (en, zh_CN, zh_TW). Locale change rebuilds all pages via `AppShell.rebuild_for_locale_change()`.

## Code Conventions

- Every module uses `from __future__ import annotations` for Python 3.10 compatibility
- `TYPE_CHECKING` guards on imports used only for type hints (avoids circular imports)
- Line length: 100 characters (Ruff)
- Strict mypy: no implicit `Any`, `warn_return_any = true`
- Ruff rules: E, F, W, I, N, UP, B, A, SIM
- Async dispatch from sync UI handlers: `page.run_task(coro)`
- pytest uses `asyncio_mode = "auto"` — no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` needed
- Test fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` provide in-memory `SQLiteBackend` via `tmp_path`

## Windows-Specific Notes

- Claude CLI `.cmd` wrappers are resolved to actual `.js` entry points in `ClaudeService`
- Git Bash path is discovered and set via `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` env var
- PATH is expanded with common npm/nvm install locations
- SQLite is the sole database backend on all platforms
